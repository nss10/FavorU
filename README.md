# FavorU

## About
* FavorU is an android application that is built with the idea to bridge the gap between a person who is need of help and the person who is willing to help. 
* In a way, it can be seen as a Craigslist for help.
* It is inspired from the Publish/Subscribe design pattern where
  - people who need help publish their requirements 
  - those requirements are posted in a pool
  - people who are willing to help consume those requests and process it
* Once the message is recieved by one of the subscriber, it gets removed from the pool 
  
  
## Tech stack
* The front-end of the application is in the form of an Android Application built using Java
* The back-end is PHP with MySQL as the database(currently detached from source code)
* This repo only consists of the front-end mobile app source code


## Future Additions
* Adding filters based on Date, Duration, Location etc on the tasks
* In app chat functionality between Publisher and the subscriber
* Recurring events
  * Post an event and make it a weekly/monthly event which automatically is added to the pool when the time comes


## Screenshots
