# FavorU

>This application was built as a part of AngelHack hackathon in 2017 in a period of 24 hours

## Hackathon Pitch
>We often see physically challenged people struggling to get things going.They live with their positive attitude towards life but still need our help for many things to happen. People often want to help them out but do not find people in need. This situation is almost similar with physically challenged people that they need help but do not find people who can help them. Now we are a team of four who just wanna take an initiative to help the people in need. We present you a platform to bring the kind hearted people and the physically challenged people under one big shelter. Our application is an android application. It is named as "favorU". Just register with the app. You will find the requests of physically challenged people so that you can contact them and help them. 

## About
* FavorU is an android application that is built with the idea to bridge the gap between a person who is need of help and the person who is willing to help. 
* In a way, it can be seen as a Craigslist for help.
* It is inspired from the Publish/Subscribe design pattern where
  - people who need help publish their requirements 
  - those requirements are posted in a pool
  - people who are willing to help consume those requests and process it
* Once the message is recieved by one of the subscriber, it gets removed from the pool 
  
  
## Tech stack
* The front-end of the application is in the form of an Android Application built using Java
* The back-end is PHP with MySQL as the database(currently detached from source code)
* This repo only consists of the front-end mobile app source code


## Future Additions
* Adding filters based on Date, Duration, Location etc on the tasks
* In app chat functionality between Publisher and the subscriber
* Recurring events
  * Post an event and make it a weekly/monthly event which automatically is added to the pool when the time comes


## Screenshots
